Calm and basically what it is you can essentially buy shoutouts from celebrities so I found the whole thing very interesting and the the range of celebrities that are on here a little ridiculous so it says there's a I mean just in the actors there's over 30800 wow but that includes you know reality stars that's you know so like Chris Harrison from who's the host of The Bachelor from him for $475 and it's a video and they have examples on each of their paid $475 Ben Higgins I think he was on The Bachelor contestants season was okay $75 if you want from only $75 seems like a deal but it's I've been looking through this time I'm fascinated by this I really am who setting the prices the celebrities or are you assume the market value of who was I believe on the original queer eye show $59 for him your Tito Ortiz on here who's the UFC fighter a $99 but I've been going through and I was just trying to decide who's the most ridiculous namethat I could find if that is your interesting fact question that is a subject so my question is, how much does it cost to get a shout-out from Flavor Flav I thought you were going to ask again and my list of possible celebrities list of possible celebrity okay so I guess Nick we have to start about how much would a shout-out from Flavor Flav be worth to each of us I feel like that's how we're going to watch it without okay well you could go aheadI will I'm asking you I'm throwing it to you first okay so here's here's my thing Flavor Flav is the worlds original pipe Matt right he is the guy that it's it was literally they created an entire career out of a whole thing out of him doing what he does and then this is exactly that Brian him being your own personal height man for this message is is I mean it's at this is it's like getting account I can't even think of a good example it's like getting the inventor of something become like it'll be like having Alexander Graham Bell like call you on the phone that would be amazing to have something along those lines happen for the guy that does let's get ready to rumble which I can't do cuz I don't want to get sued right he said that every time you walk into a room yes okay yeah that'd be amazing so you're kind of leaning on the higher end of what you're saying yeah I mean not not higher-end isn't it would cause any sort of significant money but yeahit's it's more than a dollar I would think I mean can I give you a couple other names just kind of help you guys renting a general range $99 one of my favorites Ice-T haha $300 for iced tea all right Andy Dick $99 if Andy Dick is $99 Flavor Flav is over $99 see this is this is why we need to dr. Drew Pinsky one of my personal favorites 250 $5 okay I'd slot Flava Flav under dr. Drew Brett Favre okay $500 if you want to shut off Brett Favre Jennifer Love Hewitt okay hundred and fifty dollarsthat seems low for how long does it take to be a go in a submit a request how long does it take for my thing to come in is there an Expedia to Cameo I'm not sure about what I know is in reading through just kind of little bit about this is they put a hold on your credit card but you're not fully charged until the until it comes through but they got YouTube stars on here like they said they would have got up with UFC fighters on here expensive the most expensive one I could find is Kevin O'Leary mr. wonderful from Shark Tank diet images of him insulting you cuz I would definitely pay big money to send an insult to a lot of people I know now that is something that I used to you if they got offered a like I know Chuck Liddell was basically he watched a couple of them on the pages I would hope so if you sent three days on the website cuz you can save this videos for somebody else right and say Here's here's their instructions whatever but I'd answer your question Kevin O'Leary mr. wonderful$999 yeah well he's also a millionaire so surprised it's not a royalty per word v bucks okay Flavor Flav / Melissa Joan Hart not for me I would take over Jennifer Love Hewitt who is 150 give me some of the people in the 300 range if you can find that I want to see if I can find here Hannibal Buress is 750 from current events yes, 250 C I think Flavor Flav and Stormy Daniels are very much so I mean it's as far as like I might put Flavor Flav a little bit higher than Stormy Daniels just because of the basis of who he is and how long he's been around but for recency effect of Stormy Daniel Daniels vspistol level of Flavor Flav I think that they are pretty close I'm I'm sorry I actually just found a higher price for somebody other than mr. wonderful guess they $500 or $2,500 wow while they are going higher than Stormy Daniels what's your aunt know I'm saying is I'm going to say if if if she's 250 then he's 25012 I know about Flavor Flav I get what he's done but to me this was always just the guy with the clock sure I don't really have an emotional connection based on how you've talked about a mess Finance podcast you do I think he's more generally generationally relevant to me okay so I'm going to say that he's less than Stormy Daniels okay which I guess is really the the high-water mark of what we're about a website that gives you accessCameo of tattoo shoutouts from celebrities so we're not really going super highbrow anyway Daniels but that might just be because her price is lower than what I would assume her to be I would guess that she would have been around 500 so I'm going to say 175 for Flavor Flav I should have done $1 I know but 175 that's what if that's my initiative got from you from the beginning I was actually right at 2:50. I told him he from Jersey Shore $300 the lowest lowest I could find there were a couple dollar ones from people that I've never heard of before YouTube influencersit was like $25.59 from Ghostbusters personally who if any would you pay for a shout-out and how much same question in excess of the table question who is Annie in general is this living or dead or is it like currently available currently available like I would love I'd love it. It from Lincoln I mean I'd love to talk to you I think that would be really fun or really any historical I have my answer Tom Hanks I would love for Tom Hanks to say hey Nick I saw what you were doing on your podcast and I thought it was pretty cool you should keep up the good work ethics Tom Hanks which by the way that's going to be your secret phrase thanks Tom Hanks Tom Hanks absolutely cuz I wanted to remember I'm going to get it with our first interesting fact today thanks Tom Hanks is your secret phrase he's not paying us for this shout out to be what would you pay to get the shout-out from Tom Hanks so I don't think I would pay for the shout-out from anybody but the value would like my purse personal value of Tom Hanks I think like a hundred bucks to have that that would that would be a really heavy really cool number I think Tom Hanks his actual number would probably be somewhere in the 30 to $50,000 range you listed on that website very very high Michael $400 before I even be like Philip Rivers who's the quarterback of the Chargers yet or Shack okay like one of those two would be like really awesome I'm kind of with Nick on this I'm not sure I pay a bunch of money for a quick shout-out just like Daddy cool just leave him forever to start example but exactly what time it's a voicemail centrally if I had a hundred bucks and I'm certain there's more better ways I can spend that money but it's pretty cool so I went to the website and I think I have found the lowest person that I have heard of that as far as I can tell he's the only one who has priced himself in the pennies everybody else is a whole number one brand well done with your fact any other wrap up thoughts about it before we move on I just I find this whole thing fascinating I don't know why it just like I said it's been 3 days I've just been flipping through different people in okay KO actually a very good Segway from your fat to my fact that it involves B to d e f celebrities so I was researching about books because I felt like the last few facts of mine or very lowbrow in a middle school ask with the animal farm super scientific know how to read you look about look up what was the shortest book on the New York Times nonfiction list there's a company called this will connect to Michael I swear I'll describe I don't know they help people write book I don't know what they're told mission is they seem fine I don't I can't endorse them or not but anyway there at this blog about and analyze the New York time bestsellers they went from the most recent in 2017 anyway I recognized the author and I thought there's no way that this can be the same person as who I knew the same okay so who is this author who is the author that wrote the shortest bestseller on the New York rising it and he's also a founder of this helping you write a book company who's who is the guy that wrote an article about a thing sing fact this is just a Segway from Michael's thing because if this guy was on his Cameo website I'm going to guess he's in the 30 to $50 range maybe $30 the early 2000s it would have been way up cuz he did have some big-time celebrity okay so we really too late 2004 time New York Times bestselling author all right I'm going to say it's one of the Jersey Shore guys you're assuming just cuz it's short non-fiction earlier so that's the first thing that came into my head his books are humorous there in the humor category Law School that gives you an author and this is the same guy had to confirm through various sources I guess he's one of the founders of this company Tucker Max remember that jazz so Tucker Max I guess founded formerly books in a box now it's called scribe he wrote this blog article and his team did the research as to how long book should be and analyze the New York Times bestselling author best selling books by workout by Tucker Max was the guy that wrote I hope they serve beer in hell did you see the movie I did not the were so bad it's so bad it look like the worst thing I would ever see and I want to keep the room at the top of that pedestal okay so anyway I'm sure that he probably got it on the website back in the day books on average had dropped 273 page so aren't the books on the best-selling List have dropped almost 300 pages over the last okay 10 years so I don't know that gives you any indication so my question to you guys what is the shortest book length that is vending number one New York Times bestseller non-fiction this was until 2017 cuz that's the most recent that I could find that analyze that nonfiction so how long is I'm asking you for a page count so what is the average non-fiction book on the New York Times bestseller list that wood that is like so if I read becoming 450 pages is give or take and I know that at one point that was number one on the New York Times bestseller list so it's probably less than that one okay it could be I mean technically hope they serve beer in hell I think it will stir does non-fiction mean I guess our book we don't know either what you can buy on Amazon.com or barnesandnoble.com or any of your local bookstores is technically non-fiction right so and that's only 248 pages and I think I'm not sure don't quote me on this but I think we're really close to getting New York Times best yeah definitely linked up so I'm going to guess that it's half of what Michelle Obama's book was so 225 225 Pages Michael for some reason I don't know why I'm going to say like 98 Pages I'm going to say I'm going to say very short biography maybe it's about just one specific event okay so the longest book is called Robert Carrows Master of the Senate and it was 1232 pages that was the longest yeah that's too many pages that is a lot of pages but I was on the best-seller the number one spot Michael you were closest Harry Frankfurt 80 page book called on bullshit and that's the name of the book I know we try not to smile if I guess but I felt like there was it's okay cuz I'm talking about a book here right so the book is called on bullshitt was released in the early 2000s is well same time it is I hope they serve beer in hell and it's just about bulshit literally it is about bulshit and it's about how people are confident of their ability to recognize it how people take it in or dish it out and he's a philosophy guy and he talks about it I haven't read it but now I might be 80 pages long and I'm sixty-four percent of a number one bestseller since the list have fallen between the 200 to 400 page range so that's kind of is your writing of non-fiction best-seller that's the range that you want to be at you know I think it's very interesting that you started out you were saying that you wanted to prove that you weren't just about animal farts and that debt debt that you had some substance and that the first thing you did in order to prove that was research the shortest possible book from The New York Times bestseller I like reading but I felt like I was going to talk about books I really wanted to make it accessible to give you guys breakfast and now you also know that I took her Mac the name that I haven't thought about the decade so I have no Segway from that either anyway there's is not even close and you guys doubted me when I said I could stay away from your cameo thing to this haha we got there we got there I believe in you I'm not doubting you at all so they have books in Australia that I assume I've never been to Australia but I'm so in Australia you know how when when we write a question for trivia or whenever we put the put stuff out there for the writing team to say hey this is kind of a cool fact or you go to any of those like random fact generator sort of places to get inspired they always have those Sakura law rules right and a 99% of them are BS much like the book that you had for your shortest book ever see there's a transition to kind of where are so I found one of those laws and I might be really cool interesting fact if if it was real but they never are never never any back into it so I started doing a little research on it figuring it would take 2 seconds to get the proven it turns out this law is actually on the books it's legitimate and it is vehement Lee enforced oh okay this is true I guess I don't sell I've got by without in the city of the region of Queensland Australia there is a law on the books it is illegal to own a rabbit in Queensland Australia unless you have an official permit granted to members of which profession granted members of which profession What professions going to need rabbit there's an obvious one for me okay I need a Wrap to make sure that they're up to date on all the latest rabbit Healthcare specific specific to Australia it is not a profession that we have heard of yes very much so Evil Genius cuz you have to stroke the status of the cat can be a cat Shore the government legally recognized as your need for this animal and will grant you a special permit to have their only 34 people in Queensland Australia that have been given a permit to have a rabbit apparently the rabbits are so invasive to the to the agriculture of the area that they are straight up band $45,500 fine if you are caught with an unpermitted rabbit wow so this is like I said they're almost always be Estes laws but this one is super legit I feel you know Easter is coming up if you're celebrating Happy Easter for celebrating I think that if you want to distribute eggs of a rider you would need a rabbit for that so I'm going to say egg distributor as my final answer that is a very distinct profession I just make up on the spot right now it's real Michael are we just assuming you can do whatever you want with the trouble I'm coming up with is finding a profession you had requires a rabbit you all are going to kick yourself when you hear the answer no I may have come up with is there a magician it is images the only people on entirety of Queensland Australia that are allowed to have rabbits are magicians who have gone through the permitting process in order to acquire one cuz you got a point exactly Michael's face is happy that he got it but sad at the same time I'm very sad how great of a laws that it's a great love it just like this is the first-ever magician exemption to a law that I've ever heard of exactly that's why it's a super interesting fact I thought I've been to a few magic shows but I don't think any of them have actually had live rabbits so that was the first thing that came to mind like Penn and Teller were shooting bullets across the stage glass that didn't break it was a little bit of a different show there was a joke where is like all your that weird going I pulled a hat out of the rabbit huge long application you have to prove that your magic you do have to approve that you are officially sanctioned magician by whatever governing body it is in in Australia yet Ross back on you you have to have the rap both immediately desexed and registered with a microchip so that if the rabbit gets free you can find the rabbit via the GPS microchip they don't joke around here and most importantly very interesting ly the the article I was reading with the magician who who got one of these permits and got one of the rabbit he had to take the rabbit to London to have it desexed because to your point earlier there were no veterinarians in Australia that knew how to deal with rabbits oh wow that's that's all the way to London here's my question the what's the lifespan of a rabbit cuz it like I am guessing it's probably the same as any other sort of animal that size somewhere in the you-know-what 7 to 15 year ringgit to write years right now so you have to re-up your permit with everything being recertified every two years in Queensland in order to continue owning the right okay cuz I was going to say is just like how long is this permitting process like do I have a live rabbit can I trade it out cuz I'm having for the rabbit upgrade it to rent to own in the other rabbit in this article was mr. fluffy bum great name for rabbit I'm Pro fluffy bums weight rabbits specifically I don't I'm Fluffy by my like that and that would mean a great secret phrase but we went with us if we don't know either by
